## üìö Reference Documentation

For those new to extension development or looking for a refresher, refer to the [Extension Development Basics](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/development-basics/) provided by Chrome.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up your development environment:

1. **Clone the project:** Begin by cloning this repository to your local machine.
2. **Install dependencies:** Use your preferred package manager (PNPM, npm, or yarn) to install the necessary packages. We recommend using PNPM for optimal compatibility.
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```
3. **Run development server:** You won't need to start the dev server initially, as we'll be coding and building accordingly. However, if you want to add a watch feature, it can be implemented in a future PR.
   ```bash
   pnpm build-dev
   ```
   Future, i will add watch in pnpm run:
   ```bash
   pnpm run
   ```
